# RealWorld Example App

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged full-stack application
built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) including CRUD operations,
authentication, routing, pagination, and more. For more information on how this
works, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
repo.
